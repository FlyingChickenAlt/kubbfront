        <h2>What is this application about?</h2>
        <p>Complexity comes when you enjoy different services, often at little price, lets say 5 euro monthly and you start to stack different services. At some point you lose track of the different services and start potentially to lose money, as you may don't use everything you are subscribed for.</p>
        <p>We aim at reducing this complexity and give people the power of being in control of the services they consume</p>
        <h2>Tell me more!</h2>
        <p>With kubb.in you can manage all your subscriptions in one place and be able to visualize what you are paying for and in effect, use your money wisely.</p>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lifetime Access</li>
            <li>Easy to use interface</li>
            <li>Tailored for your needs!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We wouldn't offer a product ourselves wouldn't need or use so we think you will be happy to be with us.</p>
